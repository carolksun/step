    <p> 
      I am a computer science major at Caltech, expecting to graduate in June 2022.<br>
      So far, some of the theoretical CS classes I have taken are algorithms, 
      decidability and tractability, and learning systems.<br>
      Some of the practical CS classes I've taken are data structures, 
      software design, and machine learning.<br>
      I'm excited to be taking some more in-depth CS classes in my next two 
      years at Caltech, including operating systems, information theory, and 
      databases.

      I've been lucky to have had a few internships before and during college,<br>
      including a summer research project at the National Institutes of Health 
      studying Multiple Sclerosis,<br>
      an internship at OpenX, an ad tech company, developing machine learning 
      models to predict profits, and now at Google, as a STEP intern.<br>
      As for the future, I am considering going to graduate school or working in 
      industry.
