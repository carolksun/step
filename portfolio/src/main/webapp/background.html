    <h1> Background</h1>
    <p> I am a computer science major at Caltech, expecting to graduate in June 2022. So far, some of the theoretical CS classes I have taken are algorithms, decidability and tractability, and learning systems. Some of the practical CS classes I've taken are data structures, software design, and machine learning. I'm excited to be taking some more in-depth CS classes in my next two years at Caltech, including operating systems, information theory, and databases.

    I've been lucky to have had a few internships before and during college, including a summer research project at the National Institutes of Health studying Multiple Sclerosis, an internship at OpenX, an ad tech company, developing machine learning models to predict profits, and now at Google, as a STEP intern. As for the future, I am considering going to graduate school or working in industry.
